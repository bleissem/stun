STUN
====
Ported by ASH KATCHAP from [hf/stun](https://github.com/hf/stun)
Needs the libraries: 
[HashUtils](https://github.com/forestrf/HashUtils), 
[BBuffers](https://github.com/forestrf/BBuffer) and 
[NoGcSockets](https://github.com/forestrf/No-gc-sockets). This repository is configured to download them thanks to git submodules.

This is a small, pure-C# library that implements the STUN message format with a message builder, a message parser, and its attributes.

This port is optimized to prevent generating garbage by using structs and singletons and reusing the byte array that contains the data as much as possible.
